            <p>I'm a third year Political Science Major with a minor in Environmental Systems and Society. 
            I'm Filipina and from the Bay Area, so as a critical digital map maker I hope to use this course to learn how to reclaim and make new space for my community.

            <p>
                At UCLA I'm involved in student government, work for undergraduate admissions, and play on the women's club rugby team!
                I'm passionate about all things advocacy, accessibility, and tech for social good, so after graduating I hope to pursue a career in
                impact investing or public service.

                Projects
                <ul>
                    <li>Currently I serve as Fund the UC Vice Chair for the UC Student Association, where I co-lead
                    the campaign to <a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/double-the-pell?p2asource=pell2021ucsa1">Double the Pell Grant</a>
                    to make college truly attainable for all.
                    </li>
                    <li>I also serve as Internal Chief of Staff in the <a href="https://www.evpucla.com/">USAC Office of the External Vice President</a>!
                    We're the official hub for student advocacy on campus, and you can find all of our updated projects on our website! Some campaigns I've
                    been most involved with this year include Double the Pell, BruinsVote, and Bruins for Prop 16.
                    <li>I also write for an on-campus publication called <a href="https://www.bruinreview.com/">The Bruin Review</a>! We're a group of folks
                        dedicated to cultivating discourse on campus. You can read one of my previous pieces <a href = "https://www.bruinreview.com/article/2020-the-renaissance-of-the-american-suburb">here. </a>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                Some of my favorite things to do include:
